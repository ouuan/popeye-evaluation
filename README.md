[^netlifter]: [Lifting Network Protocol Implementation to Precise Format Specification with Security Applications](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3576915.3616614)
[^pardiff]: [ParDiff: Practical Static Differential Analysis of Network Protocol Parsers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649854)

Environment is set up as Docker containers with utility scripts in the [`justfile`](./justfile).

## Get Started

```sh
just build
just popeye tests/test/foo
just pardiff tests/test/foo tests/test/bar
```

See results in the `output` directory.

## Test Case Organization

-   Each test case should be organized in a directory in `tests` that can be built with `make main.a`. Alternatively, the Makefile may provide rule to make target `main.a.bc` directly.

-   Use `$(CC)` and `$(CXX)` instead of `gcc` and `g++` in the Makefile.

-   ParDiff and popeye interfaces are unified so that the same test case code can be used in both tools. Use `popeye_make_*` instead of `pardiff_make_*`. Use `popeye_main` instead of `pardiff_main_message` as entry point.

-   Rust tests are also supported. Use Rust 1.55.0 (edition 2018 and lockfile v3):

    ```rust
    use std::ffi::c_void;

    #[allow(unused)]
    extern "C" {
        fn popeye_make_object(size: u64) -> *mut c_void;
        fn popeye_make_message() -> *mut u8;
        fn popeye_make_message_length() -> u32;
    }

    #[no_mangle]
    pub fn popeye_main() -> i32 {
        0
    }
    ```
